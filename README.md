## Phone book project

This is a learning project. I wish to implement the gained knowledge to build a simple mock app that would represent an online phonebook which will store the information about user's friend circle ( developers have no friends, only code )

## Things I want to review, and relearn with this project

1. Ruby
2. Ruby on Rails Framework
3. MVC paradigm
4. Git and GitHub Workflow
5. (Optional) Docker set up
